## How to run it


## How to setup development environment
Setting up environment:
1. Resources required for development:
    * Install an IDE of your choice ie. Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, etc.
    * Download [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
    * Download [Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/#download)
    * Download [Postman (HTTP Requests Testing Tool)](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Import the repository folder into your chosen IDE
4. This will take a few minutes to initialize
5. You can start development

The quizzz app consists of two components; a client and a server. Both of these must be run seperatly in order to work, with the serve running first and then the client. 

Running the server:
1. Run the `Main` java file in the `server` folder
2. This may take a few minutes during the initial build/run
3. In the command line it should say `started main` in the last lines
4. The server is now running

Running the client:
1. Edit run/debug configuration the`Main` file in the `client` folder
2. Click on VM options/arguments and add the following:
`--module-path="<LIB PATH IN JAVAFX FOLDER WHICH WAS DOWNLOADED>"--add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml`
3. Run the `Main` java file in the `client` folder
4. The client is now running and is interactable
