## W6 activity
    - We solved a lot of bugs last week.
    - The progress was a bit slow.
    - The planning could have been better

## W7 plan
    - The plan is to get a working app.
    - We are planning on pushing out a lot of code.
    - The plan for this week has the following qualities:
        - Flexible, the plan can change to fit important deadlines and features
        - Parallelizable, the issues are done in such a way that working in parallel is easy.
    - The switch from front-end to back-end and vice-versa is happening this week.
        - We plan on helping each other learn from more experienced people on each side.
    - We plan on testing more this week. We want to start doing implementation tests.
