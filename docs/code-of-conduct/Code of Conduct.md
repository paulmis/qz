# Code of Conduct

## Assignment description

Our task is to create a desktop quiz application to raise awareness about energy consumption and climate change. Together with the specific product, we also need to follow a methodical process for the meetings and group division. As a group in this course, we need to come together to collaboratively complete assignments and tasks. We need to communicate and cooperate with one another in order to succeed.

## Target or ambition level

Our group collectively has high ambitions for this project and our grade target is 9.5. We’d like to utilise advanced frameworks and technologies like containerization and have our application run in the cloud on AWS at all times.

## Products

Each member must be satisfied with the methodology and deliverables of this project. We have all agreed on the following methods to work on this project:
 - Our documents are shared through Google Docs for contribution of all members.
 - Communication occurs through Discord.
 - The process and the final version of the project work will be uploaded to Gitlab.

The delivered product will consist of the following:
 - A working java project following the specifications of the client.
 - Tests for all the project functionalities.
 - Documentation for the aforementioned project. Specifically:
   - Javadoc.
   - Gitlab wiki.
   - Readme file.
 - Documents detailing the planning of the inner workings of the application (e.g. the database schema or the UI design).
 - Documents detailing the teamwork process, in particular:
   - Agendas of each group meeting.
   - Minutes of each group meeting.
   - Reports of retrospective meetings.

The code will adhere to a precise style standard to improve readability and maintainability. The style will be automatically checked and the pipeline will fail if the style requirements are not fulfilled.  
We defined a standard starting from the [Google Style Guide](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml) and tweaked a few settings. The specific implementation can be found [here](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2021-2022/team-repositories/oopp-group-60/repository-template/-/blob/main/checkstyle.xml).

Testing will be performed on all components of the project, with unit and integration testing. Additional or more advanced tests may be performed as the project increases in complexity.

## Planning

In order to make sure each group member finishes everything on time we will establish an aggressive schedule where the scrum master will have the responsibility every week to contact a person in case they’re delaying their work and to warn them to finish before the deadline.  
The week's scrum master will also be responsible to make sure that scheduled deliverables are correctly submitted.

## Behaviour

We try to be supportive of each other. We make an effort to be respectful, and we try to listen to each other. However, when disagreements happen we try to form a vote collectively and ask for our teacher assistant’s advice on the matter in order to reach consent.
If every member of the group feels comfortable doing so, our teaching assistant could be involved in reaching consent. We would want to make sure that everyone is comfortable with this, and that everyone feels safe and respected. We believe that consent should be a collaborative process, and that everyone involved should have a voice.

If someone is late for a group meeting, we typically wait around for a bit to see if they show up. If they don't, we might start the meeting without them. We understand that sometimes mishaps happen, and we don't want to hold anyone accountable if they're unable to make it on time. However, we do ask that people try their best to be punctual, as their delay can be disruptive to the rest of the group. We will contact them and figure out a resolution.  
When someone is late or absent for a group meeting, we try to update that person with everything that has been discussed, with the assistance of the notes taken during the meeting.

All team members should be involved in all the activities, being those related to planning, conflict resolution or coding. Naturally, the work will be split among the members, but all components of the application will have the contribution of everyone.

## Communication

Aside from weekly scrum meetings (planning, retrospective, review) we heavily utilise GitLab and Discord to convey ideas, keep track of documents, and split the workload. If feedback needs to be urgently given individual team members can be pinged on our WhatsApp group. The dailies and MR reviews give everyone a good idea what work is being finished at any given time.

## Commitment

We rely heavily on feedback from other group members, leaders and our teaching assistant to gauge each one's commitment and work quality.  
We track the number of absences and tardies for each member, as well as the number of meetings they have attended. This information can help us identify members who may be struggling, or who are not meeting our expectations. We also hold chairs and minute takers accountable to their commitments.

Each task is clearly assigned to a group member by the scrum master. Following the principle of tacit consent, the assignee is held accountable to deliver their contribution to the best of their ability in the expected time.
The scrum master evaluates the contributions made in the past by each member (for example checking their commits on the project repository) and assigns tasks in such a way that the final contribution of each person is roughly the same by the end of the week.

We rely on each member's sense of responsibility to assure that the work is done to the best of their ability.
Furthermore, the group is heavily involved in giving feedback on specific issues (code reviews) and general behaviours (retrospective meetings), to ensure that the final product has everyone's contribution and follows their highest standards.

Twice during the project, each member will compile an anonymous questionnaire, evaluating their teammates' quality of work. This is used to gain a quantitative measurement (albeit not entirely reliable nor unbiased) of the quality of each person's contribution.

## Meetings

In general, three meetings have a fixed schedule:
- A feedback meeting with the teaching assistant, on Tuesdays from 16:45 to 17:30.
- A planning meeting, on Tuesdays from 17:30 to 18:00. 
- A retrospective meeting, on Sundays from 17:00 to 18:00.

These meetings have been scheduled according to every participant's needs. They can be rescheduled or cancelled if the whole group agrees or for specific circumstances of force majeure.  
The option to schedule additional meetings is always available, such meetings might or might not involve the whole group, depending on the meeting's reasons.  

Every meeting can be attended either in person or remotely, via Zoom or Discord.

For the scheduled meetings, in particular the feedback with the teaching assistant, we will have an agenda prepared well in advance and a scrum master who will organise it and bring up issues that need to be solved in the respective week. Another group member will be responsible for note-taking.

## Decision-making

We make decisions by consensus whenever possible. If we cannot reach consensus, then we will vote. The weekly scrum master will act as tie-breaker if a majority is not reached and the whole group will follow the decision taken.

## Dealing with conflicts

We handle conflicts within the group by trying to remain open and understanding.
We believe that it's important to listen to everyone's perspective, and that everyone should be treated with respect.
If we can't resolve a conflict ourselves, we might bring in the Teaching Assistant to help us out.

In general, problems and conflicts that can't be solved autonomously should be brought to the attention of the week's scrum master, they will act as intermediary between the two parts.
If this is not possible, the teaching assistant will take this role instead.

More personal conflicts or cases of discrimination should be addressed with the help of a student counsellor, as a group or individually, openly or anonymously.  
The academic counsellors can be contacted:  
Via email: [ac-bsc-cse@tudelft.nl](mailto:ac-bsc-cse@tudelft.nl)  
During the open office hour [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/eemcs-student-portal/organisation/academic-counsellors/open-office-hour).  
By making an appointment [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/study/make-an-appointment).

## Guidance

We expect from the teacher’s assistant to guide us regarding both content (product) and collaboration matters (process). In the first weeks we as a team are still figuring out what workflow works best for us and an experienced person’s advice will help us find out the best way to carry out our project.  
In order to make sure we are on track, we will ask for our teacher assistant’s general feedback on the progress of the content, we will ask for guidance if specific issues arise during the week, and we will ask if there is any group dynamic problem visible from an external point of view.

We are fairly confident in our ability of delivering a good product, but many group members lack the experience regarding teamwork, especially with a large group.
For this reason, the teaching assistant's guidance should focus more on the teamwork process, equality in effort and contribution, ability to have a constructive discussion, ability to follow the group decisions.

## Consequences

We will support each other throughout the project. If consistent issues occur, they will be addressed according to the agreed code of conduct.

If someone misses a meeting, getting back on track will be their responsibility, but the group will be available for clarifications and the meeting notes will be shared with all members to be used as a reference to stay on track.  
If a person misses multiple meetings we will try our best to help them work out the communication issues, however, ultimately, this behaviour might lead to action from the course staff. The same holds for missing work and deadlines.

## Success factors

The high level of cohesion, wholehearted commitment, and honest approach to work gives us a great playing field to deliver a comprehensive, well-written project.
As a group made of people experienced with software engineering we have an amazing pool of technical experience to push the project to completion and beyond early on.
