# Code of Conduct

## Assignment description

Our task is to create a desktop quiz application to raise awareness about energy consumption and climate change. Together with the specific product, we also need to follow a methodical process for the meetings and group division. As a group in this course, we need to come together to collaboratively complete assignments and tasks. We need to communicate and cooperate with one another in order to succeed.

## Target or ambition level

Our group collectively has high ambitions for this project and our grade target is 9.5. We’d like to utilise advanced frameworks and technologies like containerization and have our application run in the cloud on AWS at all times.

## Products

Each member must be satisfied with the methodology and deliverables of this project. We have all agreed on the following methods to work on this project:
 - Our documents are shared through Google Docs for contribution of all members
 - Communication occurs through Discord
 - The process and the final version of the project work will be uploaded to Gitlab

## Planning

In order to make sure each group member finishes everything on time we will establish an aggressive schedule where the scrum master will have the responsibility every week to contact a person in case they’re delaying their work and to warn them to finish before the deadline.

## Behaviour

We try to be supportive of each other. We make an effort to be respectful, and we try to listen to each other. However when disagreements happen we try to form a vote collectively and ask for our teacher assistant’s advice on the matter in order to reach consent. If someone is late during a group meeting we keep notes and try to update the person with everything that has been discussed in the time the person was absent.

If our group feels comfortable doing so, then our student assistant could certainly be involved in reaching consent. We would want to make sure that everyone is comfortable with this, and that everyone feels safe and respected. We believe that consent should be a collaborative process, and that everyone involved should have a voice.

If someone is late during a group meeting, we typically wait around for a bit to see if they show up. If they don't, we might start the meeting without them. We understand that sometimes things happen, and we don't want to hold anyone accountable if they're unable to make it on time. However, we do ask that people try their best to be punctual, as it can be disruptive to the rest of the group. We will contact them and figure out a resolution.

## Communication

Aside from weekly scrum meetings (planning, retrospective, review) we heavily utilise GitLab and Discord to convey ideas, keep track of documents, and split the workload. If feedback needs to be urgently given individual team members can be pinged on our WhatsApp group. The dailies and MR reviews give everyone a good idea what work is being finished at any given time.

## Commitment

There is no one specific way to measure the quality of member work, or the commitment of chairs and minute takers. However, we generally rely on feedback from group members and leaders to help us gauge these things. We also track the number of absences and tardies for each member, as well as the number of meetings they have attended. This information can help us identify members who may be struggling, or who are not meeting our expectations. We also hold chairs and minute takers accountable to their commitments.

## Meetings

We will try to meet outside of the mandatory meetings with the Teaching Assistant at least once per week and in the meetings we will have an agenda prepared and a scrum master who will organise it and bring up issues that need to be solved in the respective week.

## Decision-making

We make decisions by consensus whenever possible. If we cannot reach consensus, then we will vote. The weekly scrum master will act as tie breaker if a majority is not reached.

## Dealing with conflicts

We handle conflicts within the group by trying to remain open and understanding. We believe that it's important to listen to everyone's perspective, and that everyone should be treated with respect. If we can't resolve a conflict ourselves, we might bring in the Teaching Assistant to help us out.

## Guidance

We expect from the teacher’s assistant to guide us regarding both content and collaboration matters. In the first weeks we as a team are still figuring out what workflow works best for us and an experienced person’s advice will help us find out the best way for us to finish our work. Furthermore in order to make sure we are on track we will also ask for our teacher assistant’s general feedback on the progress of the content.

## Consequences

We will support each other throughout however if consistent issues occur, it affects the agreed code of conduct . If someone misses a meeting, then they will be off track, however meeting notes are shared with all members and can be referred to stay on track. If a person misses multiple meetings we will try our best to help them work out the communication issues, however, ultimately it might lead to action from the course staff. The same holds for missing work and deadlines.

## Success factors

The high level of cohesion, wholehearted commitment, and honest approach to work gives us a great playing field to deliver a comprehensive, well-written project. As a group made of people experienced with software engineering we have an amazing pool of technical experience to push the project to completion and beyond early on.
