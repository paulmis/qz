#### W7 progress
Front-end:
- We connected a lot of the UI to the endpoints on the server. Hence we are getting very close to demo/MVP.
- Made some UI changes and aditions to make the user experience better and functional

Back-end:
- We cleaned up alot of bugs and cleaned up code
- SSE is implemented really well and is fucntional as we intended.

We also switched up on roles (front-end to back-end and vice versa). It was a mixture but this week we plan to continue that transition.
#### W7 retrospective
In the week 7 sprint there were some problems:
- low priority issues were being worked on before high/medium priority resulting in delay for the demo/MVP
- We are a little behind we're would like to be, but within the next two sprints, eg. remainder of the project duration, we should finish this project and have additional features implemented

However week 7 overall went much better and was well paced. The communication went really well regarding issues and solutions. Lots of bugs were resolved by David, Paul and Rok. Meeting up to work at the same time and place was very useuful. The plan is to take all this into this sprint.

#### W8 planning

This week we want to focus on finishing must and should haves from the backlog. This will bright us closer to the demo and end of the project:
- Core features:
  - `game`: making sure that users can flow through a game without hiccups, making this experience smooth, and clean interaction with the UI. For singleplayer and mutliplayer.
  - `leaderboards`: implement various types of leaderboards to be shown to the client, eg. best players leaderboards, past games leaderboard, etc.
- Additional features:
  - `power-ups`: implementing power-up points, related `SSE` events and endpoints, logic, and UI elements for the four types of power ups
  - `chat`: implementing chat `SSE` events and endpoints, UI controls, and class structure
  - `private lobbies`: making the ability for a user to make a private lobby and host a game with custom configurations

The target is to have a demo ready midweek. Hence focus will we be on must haves. However due to our current progress we will also be able to work on more advanced features from should/could have for a full implementation by the end of W9.

#### Discussion
- How to approach testing on the client-side?
- What is the difference between nickname and username?
- What features do we want to abandon?

#### Questions to the TA
- Are we assessed on our backlog or the template backlog?
